#Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM)

A console-based Java SE application for managing students, courses, enrollments, grades, and transcripts in a university setting.
This project demonstrates core Java concepts (OOP pillars, exception handling, collections, streams, NIO.2 file operations, recursion, enums, lambdas, and design patterns like Singleton & Builder) while offering practical features like data import/export, backup utilities, and transcript generation.

âœ¨ Features

Student Management â€“ Create, update, list, and deactivate students; generate profiles & transcripts.

Course Management â€“ Add, update, search, and filter courses by department, semester, or instructor.

Enrollment & Grading â€“ Enroll/unenroll students with rules (e.g., max credits/semester), compute GPA, and record letter grades.

File Operations â€“ Import/export data using CSV/text files, create timestamped backups, and recursive directory utilities.

Reports â€“ Stream-based GPA distribution and top student reports.

CLI Workflow â€“ Menu-driven interface covering all operations.
